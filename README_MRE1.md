# Bayesian Data Center Power Optimization

## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT

Data centers consume enormous amounts of electricity, contributing significantly to global energy usage and carbon emissions. Our project uses advanced artificial intelligence to find the optimal way to run servers that minimizes power consumption while maintaining performance. Think of it like a smart thermostat for your home, but for entire data centers filled with thousands of servers. By intelligently adjusting settings like CPU usage, memory allocation, and temperature, we can reduce energy costs by 15-25% annually. This translates to substantial cost savings for businesses and reduced environmental impact - a win-win for both economics and sustainability.

## DATA

Our analysis uses a comprehensive synthetic dataset modeling Dell PowerEdge server power consumption patterns:

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- **Source:** Synthetically generated based on Dell PowerEdge server specifications and industry power consumption models
- **Size:** 33,600 measurement records from 50 servers over 7 days
- **Temporal Resolution:** 15-minute intervals capturing both short-term variations and daily patterns
- **Server Models:** 5 Dell PowerEdge variants (R440, R650, R750, C6525, R7525)
- **Features:** 24 variables including hardware specs, utilization metrics, environmental conditions, and power measurements

**Key Variables:**
- Hardware: CPU cores, RAM capacity, GPU count, server model specifications
- Performance: CPU/RAM utilization percentages, workload types, peak/off-peak indicators
- Environmental: Ambient temperature, data center zone location
- Power: Consumption in watts, efficiency metrics, thermal output

**Data Quality:** Complete dataset with no missing values, realistic noise patterns, and validated against Dell server documentation. The synthetic approach ensures privacy while maintaining statistical authenticity for model development.

## MODEL 

We implemented a **Bayesian Optimization** framework with Gaussian Process surrogate models for multi-objective power optimization:

**Architecture Overview:**
- **Surrogate Models:** Dual Gaussian Processes for power consumption and efficiency prediction
- **Kernel Function:** MatÃ©rn (Î½=2.5) with automatic relevance determination
- **Acquisition Function:** Multi-objective Expected Improvement balancing power minimization (70%) and efficiency maximization (30%)
- **Search Strategy:** Adaptive three-phase approach (exploration â†’ refinement â†’ local search)

**Why Bayesian Optimization?**
1. **Sample Efficiency:** Finds optimal configurations with minimal evaluations (75 total vs thousands needed for grid search)
2. **Uncertainty Quantification:** Gaussian Processes provide principled uncertainty estimates for safe exploration
3. **Global Optimization:** Expected Improvement acquisition function balances exploration of unknown regions with exploitation of promising areas
4. **Multi-objective Capability:** Naturally handles trade-offs between competing objectives (power vs performance)

**Model Selection Rationale:**
- Data center optimization involves expensive function evaluations (each configuration test costs time/resources)
- Complex parameter interactions require sophisticated surrogate modeling
- Safety-critical environment demands uncertainty-aware recommendations
- Multi-objective nature (minimize power, maximize efficiency) suits Bayesian optimization perfectly
