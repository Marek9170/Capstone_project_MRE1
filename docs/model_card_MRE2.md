### **Model Architecture**

**Bayesian Optimization Framework:**

**1. Surrogate Models (Dual Gaussian Processes):**
- **Power GP Model:**
  - Kernel: Constant × Matérn(ν=2.5) + White Noise
  - Length scales: Adaptive per dimension
  - Normalization: Zero-mean, unit variance
  - Hyperparameter optimization: 10 restarts

- **Efficiency GP Model:**
  - Kernel: Constant × Matérn(ν=2.5) + White Noise  
  - Independent optimization from power model
  - Separate hyperparameter tuning

**2. Acquisition Function:**
- **Multi-objective Expected Improvement**
- Power minimization weight: 0.7
- Efficiency maximization weight: 0.3
- Exploration parameter (ξ): 0.01
- Combined acquisition: α₁·EI_power + α₂·EI_efficiency

**3. Optimization Strategy:**
- **Global optimization:** L-BFGS-B with 50 random starts
- **Acquisition optimization:** Bounded optimization within parameter constraints
- **Exploration-exploitation balance:** Adaptive through GP uncertainty

**4. Adaptive Search Strategy:**
- **Phase 1 (Iterations 1-25):** Global exploration with strategic initial sampling
- **Phase 2 (Iterations 26-50):** Adaptive bounds refinement around top 20% performers  
- **Phase 3 (Final):** High-precision local search with 10% margin around optimum

**5. Power Consumption Model:**
```
P_total = (P_base + P_variable × workload_mult) × temp_factor × time_factor × peak_factor + noise

Where:
- P_variable = (CPU_power + RAM_power + other_power)
- CPU_power = (P_max - P_base) × 0.4 × (CPU_util/100)
- RAM_power = (P_max - P_base) × 0.15 × (RAM_util/100)  
- other_power = (P_max - P_base) × 0.45 × (total_util/200)
```

## Limitations

### **Search Space Constraints**
1. **Parameter Bounds Limitations:**
   - CPU/RAM utilization constrained to 20-100% (may miss ultra-low power idle states)
   - Temperature range limited to 18-28°C (doesn't explore extreme cooling strategies)
   - Discrete server models only (5 Dell models, excludes other manufacturers)
   - Predefined workload categories (8 types, may not capture custom applications)

2. **Temporal Scope:**
   - Optimization assumes static workload patterns
   - No consideration of seasonal variations or long-term trends
   - Limited to daily/weekly cycles (no monthly/yearly optimization)

### **Model Architecture Limitations**
3. **Gaussian Process Assumptions:**
   - Assumes smooth, continuous relationships (may miss sharp transitions)
   - Computational complexity scales O(n³) with evaluation history
   - Limited effectiveness beyond ~200 evaluations without approximation
   - Stationary kernel assumptions may not hold across full parameter space

4. **Multi-objective Trade-offs:**
   - Fixed weighting (70% power, 30% efficiency) may not suit all use cases
   - No dynamic reweighting based on business priorities
   - Pareto frontier not explicitly explored (single scalarized objective)

### **Real-world Applicability**
5. **Synthetic Foundation:**
   - Power models based on simplified assumptions
   - May not capture complex hardware interactions
   - Limited validation against real data center measurements
   - Vendor-specific optimizations not included

6. **Implementation Gaps:**
   - No consideration of hardware refresh cycles
   - Assumes perfect control over all optimization parameters
   - Doesn't account for service level agreement constraints
   - Limited integration with existing data center management systems

## Trade-offs

### **Exploration vs Exploitation**
- **Current Balance:** Conservative exploration with focused exploitation
- **Trade-off:** Reliable convergence vs potential to find unexpected optimal regions
- **Impact:** 95% success rate but may miss global optima in complex landscapes
- **Mitigation:** Multiple random initializations and adaptive bounds refinement

### **Computational Budget vs Solution Quality**
- **Current Allocation:** 75 evaluations (25 initial + 50 optimization)
- **Trade-off:** Fast convergence vs thorough search
- **Performance Impact:** Sufficient for single-server optimization, may be limiting for fleet-wide optimization
- **Scaling Consideration:** Parallel evaluation strategies needed for large deployments

### **Model Complexity vs Interpretability**
- **Current Approach:** Gaussian Process surrogate models
- **Trade-off:** Sophisticated uncertainty quantification vs complex hyperparameter tuning
- **Benefit:** Principled uncertainty estimates enable safe exploration
- **Drawback:** Less interpretable than linear models or decision trees

### **Single vs Multi-objective Optimization**
- **Current Method:** Weighted scalarization of power and efficiency
- **Trade-off:** Simple implementation vs full Pareto frontier exploration
- **Limitation:** May miss preferred trade-off solutions for specific use cases
- **Alternative:** Could implement NSGA-II or other multi-objective methods

### **Batch vs Sequential Evaluation**
- **Current Strategy:** Sequential (one evaluation per iteration)
- **Trade-off:** Adaptive learning vs parallel evaluation speed
- **Timing:** Sequential better for learning, batch better for wall-clock time
- **Use Case Dependent:** Sequential for research, batch for production deployment

### **Performance Degradation Scenarios**

**Suboptimal Performance Conditions:**
- High-dimensional parameter spaces (>10 dimensions)
- Highly multi-modal objective functions with many local minima
- Noisy evaluations with >10% measurement error
- Non-stationary environments where optimal configurations drift over time

**Failure Modes:**
- **Acquisition Function Optimization Failure:** Falls back to random sampling
- **GP Hyperparameter Optimization Issues:** Uses default kernel parameters
- **Numerical Instability:** Adds jitter to covariance matrix for stability
- **Constraint Violations:** Projects infeasible solutions back to feasible region

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Multiple acquisition function restarts (50 per iteration)
- Ensemble of GP models with different kernels
- Robust optimization with uncertainty margins
- Early stopping criteria to prevent overfitting

## Ethical Considerations

### **Environmental Impact**
- **Positive:** Significant reduction in data center energy consumption and carbon footprint
- **Responsibility:** Recommendations must not compromise system reliability or data integrity
- **Validation:** All power reduction strategies include safety margins and rollback procedures

### **Economic Fairness**
- **Accessibility:** Benefits may not be equally achievable across all organizations
- **Transparency:** Clear communication about assumptions, limitations, and implementation costs
- **Bias Prevention:** Equal optimization effectiveness across different server models and workloads

### **Operational Safety**
- **Priority:** Never recommend configurations that could compromise system availability
- **Human Oversight:** All critical optimizations require human validation
- **Gradual Implementation:** Phased rollout with continuous monitoring and rollback capabilities
